# üîç Shodan Network Scanner

A Python script that automates querying the [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) API for a list of IP addresses or CIDR ranges.  
It retrieves details about open ports, detected services, versions, and known vulnerabilities (CVEs), then saves the results to a file.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Reads IPs/CIDRs from a file  
- Queries Shodan using its API  
- Extracts IP, port, service, version, and vulnerabilities  
- Saves results to a text file while also printing to console  
- Handles errors gracefully  

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.7+  
- [Shodan Python library](https://pypi.org/project/shodan/)  

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install shodan
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dextan-solutions/shodan_network_scanner.git
cd shodan-network-scanner
```

Replace the placeholder with your Shodan API key inside the script:

```python
API_KEY = "your_API_key_here"
```

Prepare a file (e.g., `targets.txt`) with one IP address or CIDR range per line:

```
8.8.8.8
1.1.1.0/24
```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python shodan_network_scanner.py
```

You will be prompted for:
- The input file (list of IPs/CIDRs)
- The output file (where results will be saved)
